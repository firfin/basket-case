Basket Case is a minimalist Drupal install profile. Part of the fruit basket.
Included are make files to fetch the required modules.
Also there are (or rather will be, only one atm) installprofiles included. 
These activate module and do some basic tuning.
This installprofile will be the baseline drupal install for Wicked Fruit
This will then be extended with various 'features'.

usage for quickstart:
drush qc --domain=somedomain.lan --makefile=build-mandje.make --profile=commerce_kickstart
